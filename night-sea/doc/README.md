# After Edna Andrade [Night Sea](https://elizabethminkel.com/post/656807008243187712/oncanvas-night-sea-edna-andrade-1977-acrylic-on) (1977)

I saw this painting at the [Harvard Art Museums](https://harvardartmuseums.org/)' [*Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static*](https://harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/6455/edna-andrade-imagination-is-never-static) show. Given the highly geometric nature of [*Night Sea*](https://elizabethminkel.com/post/656807008243187712/oncanvas-night-sea-edna-andrade-1977-acrylic-on), I decided to explore it through [p5js](https://p5js.org/) like my other [art projects](../../).

The wall text for this painting says:

> "When I begin a series of paintings, my ideas are usually vague. To get started, I set up a simple geometric field, a matrix in which to play with visual possibilities."
> > Experimentation was the driving force of Andrade's practice. She developed many of her compositions by beginning with a pattern of elemental geometric shapes-circles, squares, triangles-on graph paper. Summoning her skill and technical precision with line, she would then draw that pattern repeatedly by hand, using only rulers, a compass, and a wooden device to brace her arm, altering just one aspect of the design as she moved through sections of the drawing or from one composition to the next. Her own drawn geometric pattern thus became the grid onto which she could test out possibilities by introducing color, varying the weight of each line, or layering forms. In this way, Andrade developed her own visual vocabulary by creating a series of geometric designs that became the building blocks for multiple compositions in other media.
> -->> Many of Andrade's works featured variations on the repeated pattern of a sine wave and radiating lines seen in the works on this wall. In *Night Sea*, she set this against a deep blue field; the elegant, visually pulsating array suggests waves cresting and falling across an infinite expanse. <!-- wall text Andrade rendered the painting as she did her drawings, with precise hand-drawn lines. The exact weight and form of her marks allow the pattern to create an illusion of spatial depth, movement, and luminosity, as if depicting moonlight cast across the rippling surface of the water.
-->

However, as you can see from my [p5.js rendering](../), *they are not sine waves*.
